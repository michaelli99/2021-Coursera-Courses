    "You must have a firm grasp on what you are trying to accomplish but not necessarily how to do it. You do not need to understand the entire problem. But you must understand at least a portion of it and what the program should do in a specific circumstance – what output should be produced for some given input. <br>\n",
    "2. **Start Small** <br>\n",
    "Start with something really small. Maybe just two lines and then make sure that runs. Hitting the run button is quick and easy. It gives you immediate feedback about whether what you have just done works or not.\n",
    "3. **Keep Improving** <br>\n",
    "It Once you have a small part of your program working, the next step is to figure out something small to add to it – how can you move closer to a correct solution. As you add to your program, you gain greater insight into the underlying problem you are trying to solve."

Then, you run the program with that input data and compare the output of the program with what you expect. If there is a discrepancy between the actual output and the expected output, you can conclude that there is either **1) a semantic error or 2) an error in your expected results.**"
